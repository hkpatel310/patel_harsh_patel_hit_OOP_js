## Introduction

Welcome to the Dynamic Multi-Step Form Project, a modern web application designed to enhance user interaction through a sequential data entry process. Inspired by the sophisticated forms found on automotive websites such as CarGurus, this project leverages the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a user-friendly, navigable form experience. Whether gathering detailed user preferences for car shopping or collecting comprehensive user data, this form's step-by-step approach simplifies complex data entry tasks.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a multi-step form that dynamically displays one section at a time, guiding users through a series of inputs without overwhelming them with information. Beginning with a selection of car types, users are seamlessly navigated through additional preferences, culminating in a personal information step. This methodical approach not only enhances user engagement but also improves data quality.

### Features

- **Dynamic Step Navigation:** Utilizes JavaScript to transition between form steps, ensuring users are focused on one category of questions at a time.
- **Dropdown Selections:** Incorporates dropdown menus for streamlined, error-free selections, starting with car types in the initial step.
- **Responsive Design:** Crafted with responsiveness in mind, the form is accessible and functional across a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Object-Oriented JavaScript:** Adopts OOP principles for clean, maintainable code. Features such as encapsulation and abstraction are used to organize the form's functionality.

### Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** For structuring the form and its components.
- **CSS3/SCSS:** For styling the form, with SCSS allowing for more organized, maintainable stylesheets.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Implements the form's dynamic behavior and OOP concepts without relying on external libraries.
